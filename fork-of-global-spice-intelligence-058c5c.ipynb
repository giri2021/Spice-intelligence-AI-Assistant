You're experiencing a fever. Here are some traditional approaches to managing fever from various global healing systems. Please remember that these are traditional practices and not medical advice. Consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns.\n\n**Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM):**\n\n*   **Cooling Foods:** In TCM, fever is often seen as an excess of heat in the body. Consume cooling foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and mung bean soup.\n*   **Herbal Teas:** Chrysanthemum tea or peppermint tea can help to dispel heat.\n*   **Acupressure:** Specific acupressure points, like LI-11 (Quchi) on the elbow, may help reduce fever. (Consult a trained TCM practitioner for proper point location and technique).\n\n**Ayurveda:**\n\n*   **Cooling Herbs:** Coriander, sandalwood, and fennel are considered cooling herbs in Ayurveda. A tea made from coriander seeds can help reduce fever.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of cool water, coconut water, or buttermilk to keep the body hydrated.\n*   **Rest:** Adequate rest is crucial for the body to heal.\n*   **Pitta-Pacifying Diet:** Avoid spicy, oily, and processed foods, which can aggravate Pitta dosha (associated with heat).\n\n**African Herbalism:**\n\n*   **Herbal Teas:** Depending on the specific tradition and available plants, teas made from herbs like feverfew or Artemisia species are sometimes used for fever.\n*   **Cooling Baths:** Sponging with cool water or taking tepid baths can help lower body temperature.\n\n**Native American Remedies:**\n\n*   **Willow Bark Tea:** Willow bark contains salicin, a natural compound similar to aspirin. It has traditionally been used for pain relief and fever reduction. (Use with caution and be aware of potential interactions or allergies).\n*   **Yarrow:** Yarrow is another herb traditionally used for fever and cold symptoms.\n\n**General Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Hydration:** Regardless of the tradition, staying hydrated is essential when you have a fever.
